🐍 Classic Snake Game (Python)

A fun and classic Snake Game built using Python’s turtle module. The project is structured with multiple Python files for clarity, modularity, and easy expansion.

🎮 How the Game Works

Use the arrow keys to control the snake.
Eat the food to grow longer.
Each food increases your score.
The high score is saved in data.txt and automatically loaded when the game starts.
After losing, press SPACE to restart the game instantly.

❌ The game ends if:

The snake hits the wall.
The snake collides with its own body.

🚀 Features

Smooth snake movement
Randomly spawning food
Scoreboard with persistent high score (stored in data.txt)
Press Space to restart without quitting
Clean object-oriented class design
Game over screen

Simple, lightweight, no external dependencies
